We have released DBAL 2.13, what we plan to be the last minor version in the 2.x family of Doctrine DBAL.
This release includes additional forward compatibility to DBAL 3 around
`Statement` and `Result` API and with an integration in our new
deprecations logging library.

In addition this DBAL release re-enables PHP 7.1 and 7.2 compatibility to give
as much flexibility as possible to everyone with forward compatibility.

### Statement and Result Forward Compatibility

DBAL 3.0 extracts all fetch-methods from the `Statement` API and moved them
to a new `Result` API that is returned from `Statement::execute`. We have
backported this API to 2.13 - so that you can support writing code for both
DBAL 2 and 3 at the same time.

Old code:

```php
$statement = $connection->prepare('SELECT * FROM tbl WHERE col = ?');
$statement->bindParam(1, $value);
$statement->execute();

while (($row = $statement->fetch()) !== false) {
}

$connection->executeQuery('SELECT * FROM tbl')->fetchAll();
```

New Code:

```php
$statement = $connection->prepare('SELECT * FROM tbl WHERE col = ?');
$statement->bindParam(1, $value);
$result = $statement->execute();

while (($row = $result->fetchAssociative()) !== false) {
}

$connection->executeStatement('SELECT * FROM tbl')->fetchAllAssociative();
```


The Result Fetching API was improved to use more human-readable names:

```php
// Old
$stmt->fetch();
$stmt->fetch(PDO::FETCH_ARRAY);
$stmt->fetchColumn();
$stmt->fetchAll();

// New
$result = $stmt->execute();
$result->fetchAssociative();
$result->fetchNumeric();
$result->fetchOne();
$result->fetchAllAssociative();
```

Many more changes have been made on the public API and also for the internals,
but these are the most common ones.

Thank you to [mdumoulin](https://github.com/mdumoulin) for the work on
improving the forward compatiblity.

### Deprecations Logging

We have wrestled internally for a long time with the strategy on runtime
deprecation going forward and settled on introducing a small, new API for
reporting the usage of deprecated APIs.

The reason for this abstraction is the potential for side effects caused by an
error handler and the potential overhead. We expect our deprecations to be
triggered a few hundred times in some requests as such the production overhead
must be minimal. 

This means deprecation logging is disabled by default and you must enable
it to either use `@trigger_error` or a PSR-3 compatible logger.

See the [deprecation library
README.md](https://github.com/doctrine/deprecations/) for details on how to
configure and use it.

### PHP 7.1 and 7.2 Support

A few large Doctrine DBAL deployments still support older versions of PHP that
are not officially supported anymore, but are covered by support of a few Linux
distributions.

To provide the largest possible flexibility to the ecosystem to run code with
both DBAL 2 or 3 this version of Doctrine DBAL will work again with PHP 7.1 and
7.2

### Migrate to DBAL 3

We recommend a three step strategy to move your code-base and that of your
dependents to DBAL 3. It depends if you are working on a library or
platform that is dependent upon, or if you are working on a standalone application.

For a standalone application:

1. Upgrade to DBAL 2.13 and enforce "^2.13" as a version constraint in
   composer.json
2. Enable deprecation tracking and eliminate all deprecations triggered in your
   codebase.
3. After fixing all deprecations, update composer constraint to "^3.0".
   Doctrine will upgrade to version 3 if all other dependencies you are using
   are ready as well to upgrade to version 3. If it fails, you need to identify
   and update the dependencies as well.

For a library, framework or platform:

1. Upgrade to DBAL 2.13 and enforce "^2.13" as a version constraint in
   composer.json
2. Enable deprecation tracking and eliminate all deprecations triggered in your
   codebase. Release a version so that all plugins and downstream users
   can be notified of using deprecated Doctrine DBAL directly themselves.
3. After fixing all deprecations, update composer constraint to "^2.13 | ^3.0".
   Doctrine will only upgrade to version 3 if all other dependencies you are
   using are ready as well to upgrade to version 3.

We recommend the following strategies to detect the use of deprecated code:

- Use Psalm, other static analyzers or IDEs to detect the use of deprecated code.
- If you have an extensive test-suite, register a PSR-3 logger with Doctrine
  Deprecations to catch all deprecations while running the tests.
- Otherwise register a PSR-3 logger with Doctrine Deprecations in development
  or staging only and collect and fix them as well you can. This could be
  done for a longer amount of time of days, weeks or months.
- If that is not possible, register a PSR-3 logger in production. Make sure to
  eliminate high frequency deprecations quickly or call `ignoreDeprecation` to
  snooze them to avoid overhead.
